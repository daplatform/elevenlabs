- **AI-Powered Support**: Friendly virtual bots help develop communication skills ü§ñ‚ù§Ô∏è  
- **Visual Learning**: Avatars like mothers and Santa Claus teach abstract concepts üåüüéÖ  
- **Speech Restoration**: Advanced speech recognition enhances communication abilities üîäüó£Ô∏è  

# Bloopa: An Evidence Based Solution
Bloopa redefines augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) with multimodal input, AI-driven tech, and cognitive scaffolding.

### 1. Multimodal Input
Supports speech, touch, and gestures, aligning with VAK principles. Improves linguistic acquisition (Amariucai et al., 2023).

### 2. ASR for Atypical Speech
Tailored ASR models for dysarthria, reducing error rates seen in traditional systems (Gonzalez et al., 2022).

### 3. Predictive AI Interaction
Leverages LLMs for context-aware suggestions, improving conversational dynamics (Vaswani et al., 2017).

### 4. Dynamic Concept Explanation
AI visuals and audio simplify complex concepts, easing cognitive load (Sweller, 1988).

### 5. AI-Driven Interactive Narratives
Automates personalized storytelling for adaptive learning (Murray et al., 2020).

### 6. Personalized TTS
Uses ElevenLabs' TTS for natural, user-specific voice output (Wang et al., 2018).

### 7. Emotion Recognition
Facial analysis adapts responses to emotional states (Picard et al., 2001).

### 8. Cognitive Scaffolding
Generative AI offers context-appropriate responses for non-verbal users (Wood et al., 1976).

### 9. Speech Restoration for Dysarthria
Reconstructs coherent speech from fragmented inputs (Duffy et al., 2019).

### 10. Real-Time Emotional Engagement
Adapts to user emotions via facial analysis, enhancing interactions (Zeng et al., 2009).

### 11. Scalable AAC Platform
Future-proofs its capabilities with advanced NLP and deep learning (Devlin et al., 2018).
